Astro Panic

My version of  Astro Panic created for my project 1 in CSCI 4070.
The tank is controlled by using the arrow keys, left and right, and will fire a missile by hitting shift.
For every enemy that you destroy, your score will increment by 10.
If the game is just too much for you to handle, hit shift to express your rage.
